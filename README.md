# python-programming-51042-final-project
Final Project for Python Programming MPCS 51042 Class


Project Summary
This project is a real estate investment dashboard that helps users identify high-growth areas in the U.S. for real estate investment. It provides:

Top MSAs/Zip Codes with the highest Home Price Index (HPI) appreciation.
Searchable insights on home prices, inflation, interest rates, and expected cap rates.
Exportable reports for further analysis in Excel.
Real estate investment news updates.
The backend will process public data sources (e.g., Case-Shiller Index) using pandas and NumPy, and store data in structured files (CSV/JSON) instead of a SQL database. The frontend will display analytics using Matplotlib/Plotly.


Week 4-6 Plan

Week 4: Data & Backend Development
Collect, clean, and store HPI, inflation, and interest rate data in CSV/JSON files.
Build a Flask/FastAPI-based API for real estate insights.
Implement CSV/Excel export functionality.

Week 5: Frontend & Dashboard UI
Develop a web interface (Flask + Jinja or a lightweight frontend framework).
Add search functionality for zip codes/MSAs.
Display real estate news using web scraping or APIs.

Week 6: Optimization, Deployment & Testing
Optimize API performance and data retrieval from files.
Deploy locally or on a lightweight cloud service (e.g., PythonAnywhere, Render).
Finalize UI/UX and create project documentation + demo video.
