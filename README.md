UPDATE ON SUBMISSION:

I have also included my Excel file outputs given that these are required as inputs in subsequent code and are produced as outputs initially and, hence, are an important part of my submission, especially to understand the state in which these are exported and then later formatted. 

Final Project for Python Programming MPCS 51042 Class


Project Summary
This project is a real estate investment dashboard that helps users identify high-growth areas in the U.S. for real estate investment. It provides:

Top States with the highest Home Price Index (HPI) appreciation.
Searchable insights on home prices, inflation, interest rates, and expected yield.
Exportable report for further analysis in Excel.
The backend will process public data sources (e.g., Case-Shiller Index) using pandas, and store data in structured files (CSV/JSON) instead of a SQL database. The frontend will display analytics using Matplotlib/Plotly.


Week 4-6 Plan

Week 4: Data & Backend Development
Collect, clean, and store HPI, inflation, and interest rate data in CSV/JSON files.
Build a Flask/FastAPI-based API for real estate insights.
Implement CSV/Excel export functionality.

Week 5: Frontend & Dashboard UI
Develop a web interface (Flask).

Week 6: Optimization, Deployment & Testing
Optimize API performance and data retrieval from files.
Finalize UI/UX and create project documentation + demo video.
